# Admin Management System (React + Flask)

## Overview
This project is a **full-stack administrator management system** independently developed by me.  
It is built with **React** on the frontend and **Flask** on the backend, aiming to provide a unified platform for managing users, articles, comments, and system logs with clear data visualization support.

The system follows a typical **frontend-backend separation architecture**, focusing on modular design, data-driven management, and maintainable code structure.
